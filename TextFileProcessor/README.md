Text File Processor is a basic program which reads a populated text file, lists all of the words and allows a user to search for a specific word.

Before running the program, it is vital to ensure that a populated text file is within the directory of the executable file. Otherwise, the user will be notified with ‘List is empty’ error and will NOT function as intended. 

The program may not run as intended as it was built on an earlier Visual Studio and SDK. The executable should still function but it might not run as intended.
